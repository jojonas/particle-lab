\chapter{Introduction and Theory}

In this laboratory report, the storage of charged particles and a measurement of their specific charge is presented. The experiment consists of a Paul trap, named after its creator Wolfgang Paul, which constrains the movement of a charged particle to stable trajectories by applying three alternating electrical fields. 

\section{Trapping Particles in Electrical Fields}

Beside the storage of charged particles by B-fields, it is possible to trap particles in electrical fields as well. In a static electrical field of arbitrary shape, the particle will follow the field lines and finally hit the source of the field (e.g. the condensator plate) or diverge (e.g. field of charged sphere). However, by alternating fields it is possible to create on average a minimum of the electrical potential in space. If the frequency of these fields is larger than the movement of the particle, a stable trajectory exists and the particle gets trapped. \\

In a cubic geometry (6 plates, opposing plates at same potential), the following Mathieu equation of motion holds for all three dimensions where $\xi = \frac{1}{2} \Omega t$ is the normalized time and $a_i, q_i$ are constants depending on the applied voltages and properties of the particle:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mathieu}
\left(a_i+q_i \cos(2 \xi)\right) x_i + \frac{d^2x_i}{d\xi^2} = 0
\end{equation}

The full solution of this equation is discussed elsewhere (e.g. in the lab manual\cite{Lab_manual}), the following aspects are important for the conducted experiment.

\subsection{Stability of the Particle Trajectories}
The exact solution for the particle trajectories can be expressed in an infinite series. However, the tracks are only finite under certain conditions. Depending on the applied alternating field $U_x$ and the constant field $U_{G,x}$ (same potential on both plates), the constants $a_x$ and $q_x$ change. The stability criterion is \cite{Lab_manual}:
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{a+\frac{q^2}{2}} \in (0,1)
\end{equation}
The constants in x-direction are given in equation \ref{eq:a} and \ref{eq:q}, where $K$ is a geometry factor of the plates, $m$ the mass of the particle, $q$ the charge of the particle and $r_0$ the distance of the plates to the center.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:a}
a_x=\frac{16 K q}{3 \Omega^2 m r_0^2} U_{G,x}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:q}
q_x= \frac{-4 K q}{ \Omega^2 m r_0^2} U_{x}
\end{equation}
